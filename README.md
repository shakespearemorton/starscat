Select data from the paper 'A Comprehensive Model for Bulk Nanostar Characterization', collected for public use.

Uniformity - 
  Shows the impact of tip uniformity on the optical properties of a gold nanostar.
 
Increasing Tips-
  For a few select nanostars, this shows the impact of increasing the tip density.

One Spectra - 
  Allows the user to quickly generate an extinction spectra for one nanostar.
